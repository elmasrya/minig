  Keys: 'a'= up
        's'= shoot
        'd'= down

  Libraries used were:

  jquery.hotkeys.js - for easy calling for key buttons in the javascripts
  sprite.js - to insert images into the canvas
  util.js - for my clamp prototype to limit movement of object
  key_status.js - works with jquery.hotkeys.js to further simplify calling keyboard keys

  All images during gameplay were drawn by me in micropaint
  All images leading up to gameplay were copied from flickr

  Background Story:
  Listen up Soldier!!! We heard you were the best of
  the best and our country needs you now more than ever!
  This intel is top secret and the public cannot be alerted of
  the current situation. At 04:00 Hours, one of our nuclear missles was taken by an unidentfied
  truck from the Grasslands Airforce Base in Wyoming.
  The missile silo operator turned out to be a KBG Agent.
  He has taken the launching codes! Find Him,
  and kill Him before the launch sequence is initiated.
  Then find the truck and disable it and return the missle back
  to The airforce base. God help us all! Dismissed!
